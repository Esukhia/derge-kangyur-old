# derge-kangyur
Digital Derge Kangyur prepared by Esukhia in 2013 for 84000 and SOAS under the supervision of TBRC and UVA.

This digital version of the Derge Kangyur, or e-kangyur as it is called on tbrc.org, is intended as an exact representation of the Derge Kangyur edition help by the Library of Congress. As an exact representation it preserved the likes of spelling mistakes, carving mistakes, archaic spellings and mistakes caused by wood-block damage.

This digital version isn't a new manual input but rather the result of comparing 4 different previous digital version. This process was chosen in order to minimize the creation of new errors, but of course you might still find some.
