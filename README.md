# Digital Derge Kangyur (eKangyur)

Digital Derge Kangyur prepared by Esukhia in 2013 for [84000](http://84000.co/) and [SOAS](https://www.soas.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [TBRC](https://www.tbrc.org/) and [UVA](http://www.virginia.edu/).

## Background

## Methodology
This digital version of the Derge Kangyur, or eKangyur as it is called on tbrc.org, is intended as an exact representation of the Derge Kangyur edition help by the Library of Congress ([available on BDRC](https://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=W4CZ5369)). As an exact representation it preserved the likes of spelling mistakes, carving mistakes, archaic spellings and mistakes caused by wood-block damage.

This digital version isn't a new manual input but rather the result of comparing 4 different previous digital version. This process was chosen in order to minimize the creation of new errors, but of course you might still find some.

## Format

The texts contain the following tags:

[1b.1] _[Page and folio markers.line number]_
(ཧ་) _correction of a potential error_
[རྔེའུ་] _signals very obvious potential error_

The ང། don't have a tsek between the ང and the །.

In case you find errors, kindly to do a pull request with corrections.

## Technical details

The files are UTF16-LE with BOM. `git` doesn't recognize them as text but you can still diff them with the trick exposed [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1300928/2560906).
