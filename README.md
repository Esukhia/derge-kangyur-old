# Digital Derge Kangyur (eKangyur)

Digital Derge Kangyur prepared by Esukhia in 2013 for [84000](http://84000.co/) and [SOAS](https://www.soas.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [TBRC](https://www.tbrc.org/) and [UVA](http://www.virginia.edu/).

This digital version of the Derge Kangyur, or eKangyur as it is called on tbrc.org, is intended as an exact representation of the Derge Kangyur edition held by the Library of Congress ([available on BDRC](https://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=W4CZ5369)). As an exact representation it preserved the likes of spelling mistakes, carving mistakes, archaic spellings and mistakes caused by wood-block damage.

This digital version isn't a new manual input but rather the result of comparing 4 different previous digital version. This process was chosen in order to minimize the creation of new errors, but of course you might still find some.

# File Syntax

The file syntax should be fairly easy to understand, one important detail is that some very obvious errors in Tibetan are also indicated between square brackets.
